# Challenge 2

We would like to test the code on challenge 2 making sure the app is working and displaying the proper data.
As you can see we have the `widget_test.dart` file containing a failing test that needs to be fixed and also a `unit_test.dart` where we would like to make sure that only positive integer values are being displayed to the user.

Feel free to suggest different approaches and ideas you would do differently for those unit and widget tests.
